# We are currently referencing the Krustlet directly from a Stackable fork of the official repository.
# There are two reasons for this, the fork is needed to remove the node draining behavior of the Krustlet (see
# https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/issues/523)
# Our fork / the referenced commit is quite a bit behind the official repo, as there were some breaking changes in the
# 0.6 release that we need to adapt the Krustlet to.
# We will look to move to the latest version as soon as possible, but may need to continue releasing from a fork.
