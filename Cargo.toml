# We are currently referencing the Krustlet directly from a Stackable fork of the official repository.
# The fork is needed to remove the node draining behavior of the Krustlet (see https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/issues/523)
# There is already a PR for cargo to allow patching of dependencies (see https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9001).
