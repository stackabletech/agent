This setting controls the pod address range that the agent reports to Kubernetes.
The effect of this setting is that Kubernetes will reserve address blocks from withhin this range for every node.
Depending on the setting for maximum pods per node, these will be larger or smaller ranges, and influence the maximum number of nodes for the cluster.

The agent does not require any pod address ranges, and by default doesn't specify anything for this setting.
