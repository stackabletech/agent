This parameter specifies whether to use a session or the system DBus connection when talking to systemd.

When this flag is used symlink for loaded services will be created in the currently active users home directory and no global changes made to the system.

The default is to use the system bus, which is the machine wide systemd instance.

This will mainly be useful for scenarios where no root access is possible and for testing.
