This directory will serve as starting point for packages that are needed by pods assigned to this node.\n Packages will be downloaded into the "_download" folder at the top level of this folder as archives and remain there for potential future use.

Archives will the be extracted directly into this folder in subdirectories following the naming
scheme of "productname-productversion".

The agent will need full access to this directory and tries to create it if it does not exist.
