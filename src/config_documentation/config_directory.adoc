This directory will serve as starting point for all log files which this service creates.

Every service will get its own subdirectories created within this directory - for every service start a
new subdirectory will be created to show a full history of configuration that was used for this service.

ConfigMaps which are specified in the pod that describes this service will be created relative to these run
directories - unless the mounts specify an absolute path, in which case it is allowed to break out of this directory.

WARNING: This allows anybody who can specify pods more or less full access to the file system on the machine running the agent!

The agent will need full access to this directory and tries to create it if it does not exist.
