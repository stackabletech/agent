= Overview

When the Stackable Agent starts, it runs through the following stages:

* Check configured directories and files.
** Check if the optional files can be opened if they exist.
** Create the directories where write access is required and which do
   not exist yet.
** Check the configured directories if they are writable by the current
   process.
* Bootstrap the cluster with TLS certificates but only if no existing
  kubeconfig can be found.
* Remove all systemd units from a previous run without a corresponding
  pod (see xref:stages/cleanup.adoc[]).
* Start the kubelet.

After the kubelet was started, assigned pods run through the following
stages:

* Download the package from a registered Stackable repository.
* Unpack the package and install it.
* Create the configuration files according to the config maps. 
* Create, start, and enable the systemd units.
* Monitor the systemd units and patch the pod status accordingly.
* Stop, disable, and remove the systemd units on termination or when the
  pod is deleted.
