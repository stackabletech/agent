= Cleanup stage

On startup the systemd units in the `system-stackable` slice are
compared to the pods assigned to this node. If a systemd unit is as
expected then it is kept and the Stackable agent will take ownership
again in a later stage. If there is no corresponding pod or the systemd
unit differs from the pod specification then it is removed and the
Stackable agent will create a new systemd unit afterwards.
