= Services

A pod which provides a service should never terminate on its own, so the
`restartPolicy` must be set to `Always`. As `restartPolicy` defaults to
`Always`, it can also be omitted.

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: <pod-name>
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: <service-name>
          image: <service-image>
          command:
            - <service-command>
      restartPolicy: Always

After a container command is executed the agent waits for 10 seconds
before the container status is set to running. When all containers are
running, also the pod phase is switched from `Pending` to `Running`.
