= Binaries & Packages

== Download binary
We do not at this time provide pre-compiled binaries, as we are still in the process of setting up the build jobs to create these.
This readme will be updated as soon as binary downloads are available!

== OS Packages

We provide OS packages for RHEL/CentOS 7 & 8 as well as Debian 10 (buster).

* EL7: https://repo.stackable.tech/repository/rpm-release/el7/
* EL8: https://repo.stackable.tech/repository/rpm-release/el8/
* Debian 10: https://repo.stackable.tech/repository/deb-release

Add these repositories to your OS, such as as suggested below, and then install the `stackable-agent` package.
