= Services

Services do not terminate on their own. They run until the pod is
deleted. The `restartPolicy` must be set to `Always` or `OnFailure`. As
services cannot terminate successfully, there is no difference between
these two policies. `restartPolicy` defaults to `Always` and can
therefore be omitted.

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: <pod-name>
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: <service-name>
          image: <service-image>
          command:
            - <service-command>
      restartPolicy: Always

After a container command is executed the agent waits for 10 seconds
before the container status is set to running. When all containers are
running, also the pod phase is switched from `Pending` to `Running`.
