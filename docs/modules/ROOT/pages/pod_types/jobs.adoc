= Jobs

Jobs which terminate after performing a task, must be created with
`restartPolicy` set to `Never`:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: <pod-name>
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: <job-name>
          image: <job-image>
          command:
            - <job-command>
      restartPolicy: Never

If the job terminated successfully then the pod phase is set to
`Succeeded` and the exit code of the container state is `0`:

    status:
      phase: Succeeded
      message: Completed
      reason: Completed
      containerStatuses:
        - state:
            terminated:
              exitCode: 0
              message: Completed

If the job failed then the pod phase is set to `Failed` and the exit
code of the container state is `1`:

    status:
      phase: Failed
      message: Error
      reason: Error
      containerStatuses:
        - state:
            terminated:
              exitCode: 1
              message: Error
