= Restarts

The restart count is stored in the container status if systemd version
235 or newer is running on the node which is the case for Debian 10 and
CentOS 8 but not for CentOS 7. The annotation `featureRestartCount`
indicates whether or not the restart count is set properly.

    $ kubectl get pod <pod-name>
    NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    <pod-name>   1/1     Running   4          10m

    $ kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
    Name:         <pod-name>
    Annotations:  featureRestartCount: true
    Containers:
      <service-name>:
        Restart Count:  4
