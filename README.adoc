= DEPRECATED

We have changed our efforts to use the upstream Kubernetes Kubelet instead, and as such the Stackable Agent is no longer maintained.

= Stackable Agent

The Stackable Agent is an alternative to the Kubernetes Kubelet that executes Pods not in containers but using systemd as its backend.

It is written by https://www.stackable.de[Stackable] in Rust, and it is supposed to be used with the https://github.com/stackabletech/agent[Stackable Agent] instead of the Kubernetes kubelet.

The docs can be found in the `docs` subdirectory, and they are published together with docs for all other Stackable products at https://docs.stackable.tech.
